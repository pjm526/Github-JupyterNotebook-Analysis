# Jupyer Trends

A data pipeline tool to analyze most popular libraries actively used in publicly available Jupyter Notebooks on Github given a problem domain and recommend popular Github users who follow code modularity as well as have sufficient hands-on experience in these popular libraries.

# Overview
With a massive volume of data being available to us, people are increasingly turning to Data Science to make sense of this data and put it to use.

Python being the most popular library right now, a wide variety of tools and libraries are available.

Budding data science fellows face the struggle of identifying which tools to use given a problem and getting access to the right resources to apply these tolls in an efficient manner.


My project is an attempt to shorten this searching space by identifying the most popular tools used in various Data Science aspects right from Data collection to visualizations.

Also recommending popular users on github who use these tools in their notebooks and also follow a modular coding practice

This tool also serves a dual purpose as recruiters can consider these users as their potential future employees
